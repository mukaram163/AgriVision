# AgriVision â€“ Automated Plant Phenotyping with Deep Learning

## Problem Statement
Agricultural scientists spend extensive time manually inspecting plant images to identify diseases and measure traits. AgriVision automates this process using deep learning to detect leaf diseases and extract phenotypic traits, reducing manual workload and improving accuracy.

## Objective
Develop a deep learning pipeline that:
- Classifies plant leaves as healthy or diseased.
- Automatically processes new images via a data pipeline.
- Displays insights through an interactive dashboard.

## Dataset
The project uses the open-source [PlantVillage dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease), containing 50,000+ labeled leaf images across 38 plant disease classes.  
Images are RGB photographs under controlled conditions, categorized into folders per class label.
